## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## Project rules

- All media processing runs in the browser; never add server-side processing or uploads — privacy-first is the product's core promise.
- ffmpeg.wasm is only touched through `src/lib/ffmpeg.ts` (lazy dynamic import, shared singleton, CDN core) — keeps it out of SSR and avoids loading the engine twice.
- FFmpeg argv lives in pure builders in `src/lib/ffmpeg-args.ts` with unit tests — the args are the tool's behavior, so they must stay testable without a browser.
- Image tools use canvas (`src/lib/image.ts`), not ffmpeg — instant and avoids the engine download for photos.
- Tool metadata (title, path, category, status) comes from the registry in `src/lib/tools.ts`; route files stay thin wrappers around `src/components/tools/*` — one source for cards, nav and SEO.
- `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` and `@ffmpeg/util` stay excluded from Vite optimizeDeps — pre-bundling breaks the worker URL.
